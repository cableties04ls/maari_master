The cnn_model directory contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) code written in Python. The input data size is 11x20, with a filter size of 3x3 and a pooling size of 2x2.

In the fpga directory, you will find the Verilog code for the CNN. It is divided into convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

The pulse_mode directory includes a Pulse Conversion Machine model created with Simulink.
